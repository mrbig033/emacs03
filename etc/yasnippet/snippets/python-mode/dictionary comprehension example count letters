# name: dictionary comprehension example count letters
# key: dic-example-1
# --
# I used a dictionary comprehension. For each letter in the input
# string, I make the key the letter itself ("a" for example), and the
# corresponding value is the result of running count() of that letter
# in the string.
dic = {letter: string.count(letter) for letter in string}
