# Why some adults can't handle a crying child?

#### Introduction

I'm not a parent and probably never will be. But I like children and take the influence I have on them very seriously (particularly my godson). This is also not a rant against "ignorant parents" or anything like that. I'm not the kind of person that thinks making a nice dinner every once in a while makes me a professional chef. But I like to observe human behavior, and little humans are particularly interesting (and transparent) in that regard.

This thread is an open invite to discuss ideas and practical experiences on child discipline.

#### 1. Disclaimers

Everything related to children and parenting tends to generate heated discussions, and, sometimes, gratuitous hostilities. With that in mind, please keep in mind:

- I don't claim to have more knowledge than parents, I don't think parenting is easy and I am very aware that taking care of a child for a day or two is very different from the full-job that is parenting.
- I have no intention to belittle parents (or adults in general) for the particular methods they employ to educate children.
- I have no training in psychology, education or related fields. This post contains personal feelings, opinions, and impressions.
- I observed my 3-and-a-half-year-old (41 months) nephew/godson the most. From now on, I'll refer to him as _Pete_. I'll be extrapolating from him and my general knowledge of the behavior of other young children.
- That said, defensive language is tiresome and unpractical, and I will need to be objective at points. I always try to do be nice, but please try to refrain from interpreting some of the required objective language as hostile criticism.

#### 2. Why Pete cries?

He basically cries out of frustration when he's unable to:

- make something go away (like pain)
- make something remain (such a TV show)

In other words, he cries when certain desires are not met, but he seems to understand that some desires are unattainable. My nephew doesn't ask to see Peppa Pig or the Spider-Man in the real world, he's aware that they are make-believe. When I pointed at his Iron-Man action-figure and said Tony Stark was inside, saying "but uncle, this is make-believe!" (he used more child-like words, I'm translating). Pete was aware that there was nothing *inside* the toy, and that the toy was made to represent a fictional character. My nephew is a genius! (Just kidding hahaha).

So, he desires things that he deems possible. Most of the time, he is correct (it's not hard to make that assessment for very short-term). We can fool him for a time, but it's usually not very effective.

Subjective desires (such as the release from emotional pain) can be met by comforting. Other kinds of discomfort, like physical pain, can be at least alleviated by distraction, massages, medication or by taking him to the doctor.

In any case, a child knows one thing: adults are in the way of desire. And, when they want something that they *knows* adults can give, they cry. Crying aims to accomplish the desired outcome.

#### 3. What many adults do

My generation act as if the crying of a child was grossly equivalent to a fire alarm: something potentially tragic is happening and it must be promptly silenced at all cost â€” usually by fulfilling the wishes of the children. To make matters worse, they are sometimes motivated by their own insecurities, and fear that applying discipline would make the children love them less. This is probably an exaggerated reaction to the harshness and emotional distance of some our parents.

#### 4. What I Think

Some desires should be satisfied, others should not. What lies in each group varies according to educational philosophy. But, in all cases, some desires must often be negated.

*In my opinion*, in the age of 3 and a half, all desires that aim to circumvent *sensible* disciplining should remain unmet, such as those that oppose:

- eating
- hydrating
- bathing
- sleeping

In those cases, any kind of comforting or compromising ("look, we must turn off TV, but you can play on my phone!", or "you must have lunch, but the TV will you stay on!"<sup>[1]</sup>) makes for a inconsistent application of rules, making it less likely for the children to follow them in the future.

So, if a 3-year-old opposes being disciplined and starts a crying fit, they should not be comforted or get any kind of reward. 3-year-olds already know how to manipulate grown-ups, they're smarter than some people think. They know the effect crying has, and use it effectively on overly-sensitive grown-ups. Ignoring that can lead to increasingly manipulative behavior that should not be encouraged.

When I let my nephew cry for a bit, he eventually gives up and changes his attitude. A little bit of crying can be very educational: frustration is hard even for healthy adults. Children must get used to it.

There are, of course, cases in which children should absolutely be comforted, like when they are *actually* facing potential harm, injured, sick or suffering significant and genuine emotional distress. Ignoring legitimate signs of distress could lead to trauma or even tragedies, but I believe most attentive parents, guardians and overall child-carers can easily identify when something is out of the ordinary.

And, when a child understands that tantrums will have no effect on adults, it become easier to identify when something is really wrong. The story of the [The Boy Who Cried Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf) comes to mind.
