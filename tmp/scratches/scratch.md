Being without my computer and bedroom TV (both broke day 1 of the quarantine) is a challenge, especially because this kinda forces me to be closer to those stuck in the asdhouse with me. They spend the vast majority of the day talking about politics and COVID related news, in the most morbid and negative manner possible.

I was quite depressed even before the epidemic, questioning wondering if my life would ever cease to be a never-ending succession of failures. In the last 3 years, I invested in the field of Computer Science, something I always loved as a hobby but never had the guts to try for real.asdasd

The first semester on my software engineering course was pretty awesome, I got good grades and even won an award on a hackathon. The second was a complete disaster, a flunked more courses than I passed. After being the best in the class in algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (Java, and the professor was beyond awful....) made me feel like the dumbest person on Earth. Many colleagues simply downloaded their assignments from GitHub and similar places, but I have this annoying habit of being honest.

I ended up leaving the course (for now), but not only because of that. Money is tight and private education is not cheap. There are at least three 100% free options in my city that actually offer better education. I just need to take a test, and the required score is inferior to the one I got 2 years ago.

I brought this story because in the past few weeks I decided to give programming another shot, with a different attitude. I do enjoy it, there's no doubt about that. But anxiety is frequently harder to deal than a lack of intelligence. In order to do more, I must start by doing less, without rush. ADHD and bad teachers and learning materials played a part on this, but I was also was arrogant, always trying to learn things in one go.

For the past few weeks, I'm not skipping steps. I'm also meditating, breathing, taking regular breaks and quitting before I'm burnt out. I can already see the progress. Two days were enough to get the basics OOP, something I dreaded like the plague before. When I finish [this book](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e), I'll probably tackle some math next.

So yeah, I have one thing to look forward.

To answer your question: yes, I'm quite alright, thank you for asking.
